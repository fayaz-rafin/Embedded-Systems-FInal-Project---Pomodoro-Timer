# Embedded-Systems-FInal-Project---Pomodoro-Timer
Creating a functional Pomodoro timer in Arduino using a 4-Digit 7 Segment LED Display and 4x4 Keypad and Arduino DUE Microcontroller.

## About this project:
The COVID-19 pandemic led to extended periods of home confinement for a lot of us, significantly diminishing motivation and productivity levels. Now, with the pandemic receding, there's a heightened need for tools that boost productivity and motivation, particularly for students.

A physical Pomodoro timer serves this purpose effectively by providing a tangible method for time management, helping students regain focus and structure in their daily tasks, while also alleviating the problem of prolonged screen exposure from digital devices and solving a really big problem in adults: procrastination. By breaking work into shorter periods, the timer makes tasks seem less daunting, which can encourage users to start tasks they might otherwise avoid.

I developed a Pomodoro timer function using C, incorporating break intervals and displaying the current time in minutes and seconds on a seven-segment display. I added features such as customizable study sessions, allowing users to input their desired study and break durations via a keypad. Additionally, I implemented a pause function to stop the timer and a reset function for manual resets. This project provided me with valuable insights into embedded systems and the workings of microcontrollers.
